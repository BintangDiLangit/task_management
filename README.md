# Laravel Task Management

This is a simple web application built with Laravel for managing tasks. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and reorder tasks. Additionally, it includes a bonus feature for associating tasks with projects.

## Features

-   Create tasks with information such as task name, priority, and timestamps.
-   Edit existing tasks.
-   Delete tasks.
-   Reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality. The priority is automatically updated based on the new order.
-   Associate tasks with projects. Users can select a project from a dropdown and view tasks associated with that project.
